# FFNeuralNetwork-BackPropogation

Use iPython Notebook to implement a feed-forward neural network with back-propagation
use numpy and scikit-learn low-level functionality, but not their pre-built implementations of grad descent etc
Dataset used: procedurally-generated dataset that is small but not linearly separable
Goal: Build and train a neural net with one hidden layer, and see how well you can perform on a held-out portion of it
test
